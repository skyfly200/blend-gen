# BlendGen Framework: Modular Generative Design in Blender

## Overview
The BlendGen Framework is an innovative system designed for Blender enthusiasts, 3D artists, and procedural design architects. It leverages the power of Blender's Python API to introduce a customizable, modular approach to generative modeling. This project empowers users to create complex, parameter-driven designs through a nested system of generators, making the process both efficient and highly adaptable.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design System**: At the heart of BlendGen is a modular architecture, allowing designers to create, configure, and combine individual components into sophisticated top-level assemblies.
- **Parameter-Driven Modeling**: Each module in the design system can be finely controlled through external configuration files, enabling users to tweak and experiment with designs without altering the core code.
- **Recursive Composability**: The framework supports a recursive structure where each component can itself contain a system of subcomponents, offering unparalleled complexity and detail in design generation.
- **Export Flexibility**: A built-in functionality to export generated designs either as individual components or as a whole assembly in popular formats like OBJ and STL, directly controlled through configuration settings.
- **User-Friendly Configuration**: All settings and parameters are managed via easy-to-edit JSON files, making the system accessible even to those who might not be proficient in Python scripting.

## Target Audience

- **Experienced Blender Users**: While accessible, the framework is tailored for users who have a basic understanding of Blender's environment and Python scripting.
- **3D Modelers and Designers**: Professionals and hobbyists in the 3D modeling space will find this tool particularly useful for creating unique and complex designs.
- **Educators and Researchers**: Those in academic or research settings exploring computational design and procedural generation.
